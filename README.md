NoSql Fitness Tracker HW App

For this assignment I have added the back-end to this fitness tracker application. I have done so by expanding the api.js file in the routes folder as well as adding an html.js file to add routes to the html pages. I have also modified the public api.js file to change any routes that were incorrect. 

The main focus was to make the data entered via user input in the exercise page "talk" to the dashboard and front page in order to fill in the data. This was achieved by creating the routes in the api file in the routes folder and particular difficulty was had with finding the right id (hence the findByIdAndUpdate function) and pushing the data up.

I was unable to resolve the duration requirement.
